# WhatShouldWeTagMe Auto Tagging Software

This software includes classifiers that yield a probability score of presence of
certain features in a given image. For instance, one classifier could be testing
presence of a building in an image and for a given input it may return some
probability `P_building(input) = x`, where x is a real value `(0, 1>`.

The goal is to have trained 64 classifiers by the end of 2015.

## Data

The images and their computed features (in plain text) reside here.

## Program

Computer vision software with the machine learning algorithms for classifying 
images.
